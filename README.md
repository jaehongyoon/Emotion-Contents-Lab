# EOG Cancel
LabVIEW program for calceling out artifact from EOG while recording EEG. The EEG measured are used for controlling BIC program for Public Welfare project sponsered by National Research Foundation of Korea and the Ministry of Health & Welfare of Korea.

# MATLAB Stat test module
Various MATLAB statistics analysis tools.

# NeuroSky
BCI system for Public Welfare project sponsered by National Research Foundation of Korea and the Ministry of Health & Welfare of Korea.
